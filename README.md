# Abstract

This thesis aims to bring a solution that improves the domain of driver monitoring and assistance for video telematics on embedded devices. We propose a solution based on a single camera visual input for Safe Distance Warning systems and Lane Departure Warning systems based on multiple stacked deep neural networks for various tasks and a computer vision algorithm for detection interpolation using accumulative features masks.

In the Introduction (Chapter 1), we present a broader perspective of the problem, the context in which we are solving it, and a more detailed structure of the thesis.

In Chapter 2, we describe the concepts, techniques, optimization methods, building blocks, and specialized deep learning architectures used during this thesis's research and development stages.

Finally, in Chapter 3, we present our in-depth solution, the problems encountered during development, and the ideas that helped solve them. Chapter 4 presents real-world results of the system and statistical measures quantified from a large number of vehicles.

The Chapter 5 ends this thesis based on a summarized description of our contribution to the domain driver monitoring systems on embedded devices and presents possible future directions for improving our solution.
